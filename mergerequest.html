## Intro
      
TODO: Talk about branches to tie in last DevCop and also because merges are only needed when you have multiple branches.

---
      
      
## What is a Pull Request ?
      
--

Pull Requests allow you to visualize and collaborate on the proposed changes to source code that exist as commits on a given branch.
They are a request to merge one branch into another.
They help a team establish, enforce and verify policies on all code changes.
      
Note: Pull requests are also refered to as Merge Requests on some platforms.

## What is the goal of a Merge Request ?

      TODO: Review these are not correct and order them in order of importance
      TODO: ??? Is this would be a good place to talk bout unit testing as a pre-requisite.

.answer[
- Spread knowledge across the team.
- Increase the quality of the product
- Collaboration and Learning
- Identify design flaws
- Code reusability

## Roles and responsibilities of submitter and reviewer

### Submitter
--

 TODO: write examples, and order them in order of importance
      
.answer[
- The first reviewer of your code is you. Does it make sense? Did you include something unrelated to the overall purpose of the changes? Did you forget to remove any debugging code?
- Keep Code review short
- Describe the changes in the Merge Request. Link to task.
- Contains a single task. Don't mix features.      
- New functions and conditions come with new unit tests
- Changed functions and conditions don't effect existing unit tests
- Complex sections of code contains comments.
]

### Reviewer
--

 TODO: write examples, and order them in order of importance
      
.answer[
- Review the code as soon as possible, defer if review is not possible
- When approving a merge, you are just as responsible for the changes as the person who made them. So you should understand them just as well.
- Be effective in comments, Recommend changes in a constructive manner
- Investigate for design flaws and code reusability (does this code already exist somewhere in the project, does a function already exist for this)
]

---

## How do I keep reviews from taking up all my time?

.answer[
- Keep the changes small! If the change is too large and could have been broken appart, reject it.
- Don’t validate the code in your reivew. Let the pipeline do that work for you. Focus on learning what it is the author is trying to do, and check that what they did makes sense.
- If you don’t understand the change, ask for more details. Don’t spend time trying to figgure it out, it should be simple enough (or explained in comments) to understand in a minute or two.

TODO: Show Picture of BigMerge.png, describe why it's not easy for reviewer
TODO: Show Picture of RefactorMerge.png, describe how "big merges" are still possbile if scope is respecte

## Types of Commits

TODO: Find proper images...
      
.answer[
- Merge Commit: Creates a new commit on the branch you're merging to that point to the existing branch and the branch being merged.
- Squash & Merge: Combine all your merge request’s commits into a single commit, then creates _merge commit_ which retains a clean history.
- Rebase: Replays all the commits on your branch (creating new commits with identical changes) against the _head_ of the branch you are merging to; then fast-forwards the _head_ of the merging branch to the _head_ of your replayed branch.
