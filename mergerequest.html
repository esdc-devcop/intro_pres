## What is a Pull Request ?
      
TODO: Talk about branches to tie in last DevCop and also because merges are only needed when you have multiple branches.

Pull requests are also refered to as Merge Requests on some platforms.
      
--

Pull Requests allow you to visualize and collaborate on the proposed changes to source code that exist as commits on a given branch.
They are a request to merge one branch into another.
They help a team establish, enforce and verify policies on all code changes.

## What is the goal of a Merge Request ?

      TODO: Review these are not correct and order them in order of importance
      TODO: ??? Is this would be a good place to talk bout unit testing as a pre-requisite.

### Submitter

.answer[
- New functions and conditions come with new unit tests
- Changed functions and conditions don't effect existing unit tests
- Keep Code review short
- Comment the "difficult" parts of your code.
- Describe the changes in the Merge Request. Link to task.
- Changes for a single task or less. Don't mix features.

### Reviewer
--

 TODO: write examples, and order them in order of importance
      
.answer[
- Review the code as soon as possible, defer if review is not possible
- Be effective in comments, Recommend changes in a constructive manner
- Set aside personal "tastes" for source code.
- Investigate for design flaws and code reusability (does this code already exist somewhere in the project, does a function already exist for this)
]
