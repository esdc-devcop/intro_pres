## A new beginning
      
A new strategy        
[https://esdc-devcop.github.io/strategy/](https://esdc-devcop.github.io/strategy/)
      
.okay[It's not going to be the same!]

Stopping the theoretical changes we want you to make, and show you how to implement **meaningful** changes **today**.

## What are we talking about?

**Where are we at?**  
--

.whoah[Broken manual builds, poorly documented features, not user-focused, complicated intertwined systems]
--


**Where do we need to be?**  
--

Cloud-enabled, automated deployments, focused and isolated features
--


**What is practical right now?**  
--

.okay[All of it!]
--


**How do we get there?**  
--

Small incremental steps. 
Breaking out of what we are comfortable with to do what is better.
Collaborating to share what works.

## A Starting Point

### Platform

Where and how do we develop code?   
How do we enable ourselves to be the most effective at achieving our goals?

.okay[Move source control to Git]

## Why Git?

It's not an arbitrary choice, and it's not one that was looked at lightly.
- Globally accepted standard
- Versatility of being distributed (DVCS)
- Free & Open-Source!!
- Enabling better development practices
- Critical in taking further steps towards modern application development.
- And finally, even Microsoft made the jump!!!

There are tools to help the transition!

## About Git

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. 
Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.  

Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). 
Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN).
In Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.  

In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.
