# Developer's Community of Practice

## Building blocks towards modern software development.

## A new beginning
      
A new strategy        
[https://esdc-devcop.github.io/strategy/](https://esdc-devcop.github.io/strategy/)
      
.okay[It's not going to be the same!]

Stopping the theoretical changes we want you to make, and show you how to implement **meaningful** changes **today**.

## What are we talking about?

**Where are we at?**  
--

.whoah[Broken manual builds, poorly documented features, not user-focused, complicated intertwined systems]
--


**Where do we need to be?**  
--

Cloud-enabled, automated deployments, focused and isolated features
--


**What is practical right now?**  
--

.okay[All of it!]
--


**How do we get there?**  
--

Small incremental steps. 
Breaking out of what we are comfortable with to do what is better.
Collaborating to share what works.

## A Starting Point

### Platform

Where and how do we develop code?   
How do we enable ourselves to be the most effective at achieving our goals?

.okay[Move source control to Git]  
https://git-scm.com/

## Why Git?

It's not an arbitrary choice, and it's not one that was looked at lightly.
- Globally accepted standard
- Versatility of being distributed (DVCS)
- Free & Open-Source!!
- Enabling better development practices
- Critical in taking further steps towards modern application development.
- And finally, even Microsoft made the jump!!!

There are tools to help the transition!

## About Git

Free and open source version control system used for tracking changes in code during development

Similar but at the same time, very different from other version control systems (ex. SVN)

--

Distributed 

- every developer’s working copy of code has a full history of all changes

--

Advantages of using Git

- available offline
- efficient
- no single point of failure

???

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. 
Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.  

Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). 
Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN).
In Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.  

In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.

## About Git

The branching model has been made easy
- Main branches:
 - Master
 - Develop

- Supporting branches:
 - Feature
 - Release
 - Hotfix

--

Stages of Git
 - Working directory
 - Staging area
 - Git directory

---

## Migrating to Git

### When can you start? 
--
**.okay[Right now!]**
--

- TFS supports Git and mixing Git/TFVC repos in the same project.
- Git is the default version control provider for new projects in Azure DevOps (Online & On-Prem).
- Microsoft advises using Git over TFVC.
- Integrated Git support in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
  - You will want to learn some basic commands.

- [Comparison of Git and TFVC capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc?view=azure-devops)
---

## Migration Tool

### git-tfs

- Recommended by Microsoft and Pro Git Book on [Git-SCM](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git#_git_tfs).

- [Microsoft - Migrate from TFVC to Git - Advanced Migrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/git/migrate-from-tfvc-to-git#advanced-migrations)
  - [GitHub - git-tfs](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs)
  - [Using git-tfs to migrate from TFVC to Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git#_git_tfs)

## Hosting your Git Repositories

### .okay[Great! You've got a local Git repo. Now what?]
--

Pick a hosting service for your version control! (Remote Repository)
--

- **TFS** - *Status quo*
--

  - Keep your old toys.
      - Work Items
      - Build/Release Definitions
      - Test Plans
      - etc.
--
  - Might improve with Azure DevOps Server.
--

- **GCcode** - *New Initiatives/Projects*
--

  - Shiny new toys!
--

  - Learning curve
--

  - Babystep towards sharing code publicly.
      - *Keep secrets out of your repos!*
--
- **GitHub** - *Future Goal?*

## We are going to help!

### Workshop!  
#### .okay[September 17]  
All afternoon, we are available for drop-in (online too!).  
Bring your laptop to 7C001 and we'll help walk you through the migration to Git.
