# Developer's Community of Practice

## Building blocks towards modern software development.

## A new beginning
      
A new strategy        
[https://esdc-devcop.github.io/strategy/](https://esdc-devcop.github.io/strategy/)
      
.okay[It's not going to be the same!]

Stopping the theoretical changes we want you to make, and show you how to implement **meaningful** changes **today**.

## What are we talking about?

**Where are we at?**  
--

.whoah[Broken manual builds, poorly documented features, not user-focused, complicated intertwined systems]
--


**Where do we need to be?**  
--

Cloud-enabled, automated deployments, focused and isolated features
--


**What is practical right now?**  
--

.okay[All of it!]
--


**How do we get there?**  
--

Small incremental steps. 
Breaking out of what we are comfortable with to do what is better.
Collaborating to share what works.

## A Starting Point

### Platform

Where and how do we develop code?   
How do we enable ourselves to be the most effective at achieving our goals?

.okay[Move source control to Git]  
https://git-scm.com/

class: middle

## Why Git?

It's not an arbitrary choice, and it's not one that was looked at lightly.
- Globally accepted standard
- Versatility of being distributed (DVCS)
- Free & Open-Source!!
- Enabling better development practices
- Critical in taking further steps towards modern application development.
- And finally, even Microsoft made the jump!!!

There are tools to help the transition!

## About Git

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. 
Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.  

Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). 
Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN).
In Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.  

In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.

## Migrating to Git

### When can you start? 
--
**.okay[Right now!]**
--

- TFS supports Git and mixing Git/TFVC repos in the same project.
- Git is the default version control provider for new projects in Azure DevOps (Online & On-Prem).
- Microsoft advises using Git over TFVC.
- Integrated Git support in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
  - You will want to learn some basic commands.

- [Comparison of Git and TFVC capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc?view=azure-devops)
---

## Migration Tool

### git-tfs

- Recommended by Microsoft and Pro Git Book on [Git-SCM](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git#_git_tfs).

- [Microsoft - Migrate from TFVC to Git - Advanced Migrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/git/migrate-from-tfvc-to-git#advanced-migrations)
  - [GitHub - git-tfs](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs)
  - [Using git-tfs to migrate from TFVC to Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git#_git_tfs)

## Hosting your Git Repositories

### .okay[Great! You've got a local Git repo. Now what?]
--

Pick a hosting service for your version control! (Remote Repository)
--

- **TFS** - *Status quo*
--

  - Keep your old toys.
      - Work Items
      - Build/Release Definitions
      - Test Plans
      - etc.
--
  - Might improve with Azure DevOps Server.
--

- **GCcode** - *New Initiatives/Projects*
--

  - Shiny new toys!
--

  - Learning curve
--

  - Babystep towards sharing code publicly.
      - *Keep secrets out of your repos!*
--
- **GitHub** - *Future Goal?*
