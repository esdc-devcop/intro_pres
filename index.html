## What are we talking about?

**Where are we at?**  
--

.whoah[Broken manual builds, poorly documented features, not user-focused, complicated intertwined systems]
--


**Where do we need to be?**  
--

Cloud-enabled, automated deployments, focused and isolated features
--


**What is practial right now?**  
--

.okay[All of it!]
--


**How do we get there?**  
--

Small incremental steps. 
Breaking out of what we are comfortable with to do what is better.
Collaborating to share what works.

## Why Git?

It's not an abitrary choice, and it's not one that was looked at lightly.
- Globally accepted standard
- Versatility of being distributed
- Free & Open-Source!!
- Enabling better development practices
- Critical in taking further steps towards modern application development.

There are tools to help the transition!
